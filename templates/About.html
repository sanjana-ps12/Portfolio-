        <p>Hello I'm Sanjana, a passionate engineering student currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at <strong>Shri Madhwa Vadiraja Institute of Technology and Management.</strong>I'm specializing in <strong> Artificial intelligence and Machine learning</strong>, where I explore how intelligent system can be built using modern tools and techniques.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I'm deeply interested in <strong>Robotics and Drone Technology</strong>. I enjoy exploring how hardware and software can work together to create autonomous systems and I'm, always excited to learn more about building, programming, and improving such intelligent machines. Recently I have started studying about <strong>Web Designing</strong> and I'm really enjoying creative process of building clean, user-friendly websites.<br> I'm fascinated by how design, development and work hand-in-hand to create engaging user experience.<br>I also love working on hands-on project, learning new technologies, and improving my skills in language like Java, C, Python, C++. I enjoy them to build useful applications and solve problems creatively.</p>
        <p>My dream is to become a <strong>skilled software developer</strong>, combining my interests in AI, robotics, drones, and web development to contribute to impactful, innovative solutions.</p>
